## To-do list
#### I'll increase this list as I realize what I need to improve or maybe add

- [ ] Fix the navbar
- [ ] Resize the components
- [ ] Start thinking about more pages and how to navigate among them
- [ ] make this somewhat relevant
### Some comments...

Some crappy layout done, and now I'm gonna start working on the
database and the schemas, and further changing the hard coded posts
to the actual posts from database

ADDED SSL BABYYYYY

I'm kinda enjoying doing this, it's relaxing and instigating, but I'm really anxious to start working on the backend part
